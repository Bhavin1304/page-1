<p><b><u><h1><i>karma yog</i></u></b></p></h1>
<p> According to Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, Karma yoga is the spiritual practice of "selfless action performed for the benefit of others".[10][11] Karma yoga is a path to reach moksha (spiritual liberation) through work. It is rightful action without being attached to fruits or being manipulated by what the results might be, a dedication to one's duty, and trying one's best while being neutral to rewards or outcomes such as success or failure.[12] Within Hinduism, this concept is known as seva, meaning selfless service to others as a means of spiritual practise</p>
